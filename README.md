# Atoms

A fun little project to play around with molecular dynamics. You can specify different forces, as well as pick a random force (via Laguerre polynomials with random coefficients). By default it uses the Lennard-Jones potential, with a Nose-Hoover-Langevin thermostat. You can use your up and down arrows to change the target temperature.

# Building

Just use cmake, it should fetch the submodules automatically
